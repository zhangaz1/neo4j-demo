A classic example of a trophic cascade is the re-introduction of wolves into Yellowstone in 1995 after a 70-year hiatus. This triggered a massive trophic cascade, involving different predators, prey, plants and even physical landscape. Wolf reintroduction may represent an effective method for passively restoring ecosystems. This GraphGist explores the Wolf’s role in the ecosystem of Yellowstone. ",

While no fraud prevention measures can ever be perfect, significant opportunity for improvement lies in looking beyond the individual data points, to the connections that link them. Oftentimes these connections go unnoticed until it is too late— something that is unfortunate, as these connections oftentimes hold the best clues.",

As you might expect, this scenario involves flow through a network, and is therefore fairly simple to model in Neo4j.",
